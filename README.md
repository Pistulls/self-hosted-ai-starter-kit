## Installation

| Case | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Non NVIDIA or Apple Silicon | `docker compose --profile cpu up` | Runs the starter kit on CPU |
| NVIDIA GPU users | `docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up` | Runs the starter kit using NVIDIA GPU |
| Mac / Apple Silicon users | `docker compose up` | Runs Ollama on Mac for faster inference, connecting from n8n instance |

Note: For Mac/Apple Silicon users, there's an alternative option to run fully on CPU using the same command as for "Non NVIDIA or Apple Silicon" cases.

After you followed the quick start set-up below, change the Ollama credentials
by using `http://host.docker.internal:11434/` as the host.

With your n8n instance, you‚Äôll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.


## Upgrading

### For Nvidia GPU users

```
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

```
docker compose pull
docker compose create && docker compose up
```

### For everyone else

```
docker compose --profile cpu pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you‚Äôll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.
